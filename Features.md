### A Key-Value store
* Used as a client for memcached using spymemcached

### Zone Based Replication
* Can create clusters based on availability zone for an EVCache app. This improves reliability and availability of the data.

### Zone Affinity for Reads
* Eliminate cross zone traffic and improve the latency by reading the data from the local zone. 

### Dynamically re-sizable cluster
* The cluster size can be changed by adding or removing nodes. The EVCache client automatically configures (Eureka) to the new size. 

### Connection Pools and Management
* Create a Pool of connections to each EVCache App
* Separate pools for Read and Write Operations

### Zone Fallback
* If a request to a zone fails (instance containing the data has crashed or the cluster size is increased causing a rehash of keys or a new ASG has been added) you can have clients fallback to other zones containing the data. 
This will incur an additional cost but typically is a lot smaller than going to the source of truth. 

### Set a zone to write only mode
* An availability zone can be set to "Write only Mode" until the cache is substantially full. In this mode all the reads from that zone will be sent to other zones.

##Eureka Specific Features

### Resilient to state in Eureka
* Be passive when disconnecting from EVCache server i.e. if eureka drops a server the client should not remove it until the connection is lost.
